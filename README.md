# BBRsim

Geant4-based free-space blackbody radiation (BBR) simulation for cryogenic
experiments. Continues the work of Yen-Yung Chang (Caltech PhD, 2023, Ch. 5)
and implements the technical scope of the Golwala / Mirabolfathi NSF QIS
proposal *BBRsim: Free-Space Blackbody Radiation Simulation for
Superconducting Circuits and Cryogenic Detectors* (2025).

## Why this exists

Superconducting-circuit qubits and sub-Kelvin phonon-mediated particle
detectors are limited by non-thermal quasiparticle populations. One cause is
free-space BBR leaking through machining gaps, cable slots, and flange-lid
joints in otherwise "sealed" cryostat chambers. BBR from a 4 K surface peaks
near λ = 1.3 mm, comparable to or larger than typical mating tolerances, so
every nominally closed chamber behaves as a leaky waveguide for long-wavelength
photons. Existing tools handle either open-volume ray-tracing or wave
propagation in gaps — not both consistently on CAD-accurate geometry.

BBRsim does both: ray-trace in open volumes via Geant4 optical photons, and
wave propagation through gaps via pre-computed HFSS S-parameters — on the same
event-by-event footing, so BBR backgrounds can be simulated rather than
debugged after the fact.

## Status (June 2026)

Core physics is operational and validated. The HFSS diffraction path, the Cu
reflectance model, and the Planck thermal emitter are all implemented and
tested. CAD-accurate geometry import and the non-Cu material database are the
next milestones.

### Working

- **HFSS diffraction** — `BBRHFSSData` loads far-field + waveguide CSVs; `BBRCrackLibrary`
  lazy-loads datasets by volume name; `BBSimOpBoundaryProcess` intercepts photons entering
  `vacuum_wg` crack volumes and routes them through the HFSS lookup.
  Validated at 500 GHz normal incidence: observed transmittance 51.9% (50 µm
  gap) / 50.5% (100 µm gap), consistent with the 50% unpolarized ideal — only
  the TEM component transmits through a sub-cutoff gap.

- **Cu reflectance** — Full complex Drude model (σ(ω) = σ_DC/(1−iωτ) in
  ε̃ = 1 + iσ/(ε₀ω); Griffiths §9.4 generalized) parameterized by RRR and
  temperature. `BBRMaterials::GetCopper(RRR, T_K)` builds a 24-point log-spaced
  REFLECTIVITY table from 10 GHz to 20 THz. Three named grades available; users
  may also supply any integer RRR directly.

- **Planck thermal emitter** — `ThermalSurface` + `GetBBSpecCDF`: box-surface
  emitter sampling the Planck photon-number spectrum (10 GHz–20 THz), with
  per-surface emissivity weighting. Default mode of `BBRTestPGA`; temperature
  set at runtime via `/bbr/thermal/setT`.

- **Test geometry** — `BBRTestDetectorConstruction`: 50 cm world, 4 mm Cu slab,
  two `vacuum_wg` crack daughters at z = 0 and z = 3 mm. Cu material and gun
  position fully configurable via messenger before `/run/initialize`.

### Not yet implemented

- CADMesh / SOLIDWORKS `.STL` import
- Patched `G4OpBoundaryProcess` with `REFLECTIVITY` on `G4MaterialPropertiesTable`
  (upstream Geant4 PR target)
- ROOT `TTree` absorption output and leakage-current post-processing
- Full cryogenic material database beyond Cu (Si, Ge, Cirlex, PCB)
- BBR calibration geometry (BB source + mesh-TES detector models)

## Build

**Prerequisites:** Geant4 11.x (built with optical physics), CMake ≥ 3.16,
a C++17 compiler. Python scripts require the `bbrsim` conda environment
(NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Pandas).

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

Batch-only (no UI/visualization):

```bash
cmake -DWITH_GEANT4_UIVIS=OFF ..
make
```

CMake copies all `.mac` files to the build directory alongside the executable.

## Run

The executable is `BBRSim` (not `OpNovice2`). All commands below run from the
`build/` directory.

### Planck emitter + crack diffraction

```bash
./BBRSim planck.mac          # 10 000 thermal photons at 4 K
./BBRSim test.mac            # 5M-event production run at 4 K
./BBRSim test_10K.mac        # 1M events at 10 K
```

Photons entering the `vacuum_wg` cracks are routed through the HFSS lookup;
expected transmittance at 500 GHz normal incidence is ≈ 50% per crack (the
unpolarized TEM-only ideal; observed 51.9% / 50.5%). All boundary crossings are logged to `test_output.csv`
(columns include `run_id`, positions, momenta, materials, boundary status).

```bash
conda run -n bbrsim python scripts/check_planck_spectrum.py build/test_output.csv --temp 4
conda run -n bbrsim python scripts/check_crack_ratio.py build/test_output.csv
```

### Cu reflectance smoke test

```bash
./BBRSim reflectance.mac     # OFHC_Cu (RRR=100), 500 GHz, 10 000 events
./BBRSim test_of_cu.mac      # OF_Cu   (RRR=3),   500 GHz, 2 000 events
./BBRSim test_hp_cu.mac      # HP_Cu   (RRR=6),   500 GHz, 2 000 events
```

Output: `[BBR] reflectance mat=... N=... A_obs=... R_theory=...` printed to stdout.
At 4 K OFHC Cu sits on the relaxation plateau (D ≈ 4.9×10⁻⁵ at 500 GHz).
Compare against Drude theory:

```bash
./BBRSim reflectance.mac
conda run -n bbrsim python scripts/check_reflectance.py
```

Plot reflectance vs frequency across Cu grades and temperatures:

```bash
conda run -n bbrsim python scripts/plot_cu_reflectance.py
# output: build/cu_reflectance_plots.png
```

### Setting Cu material at runtime

In any mac file, before `/run/initialize`:

```mac
# Named alias (sets RRR and temperature to 4 K)
/bbr/det/setCuMaterial OFHC_Cu

# Direct RRR input (any integer >= 1)
/bbr/det/setCuRRR 300

# Warm shield layer: set temperature first, then RRR
/bbr/det/setCuStageT 40 K
/bbr/det/setCuRRR 50
```

Valid aliases: `OFHC_Cu` (RRR=100), `OF_Cu` (RRR=3), `HP_Cu` (RRR=6).
σ_DC is derived automatically as RRR × 5.96×10⁷ S/m.

### Wrapper regression

`BBSimOpBoundaryProcess` falls through to the stock `G4OpBoundaryProcess` for
any geometry without `vacuum_wg` or `REFLECTIVITY` materials. The historical
fixed-seed regression macro (`verify_wrapper.mac`) was retired with the
OpNovice2 geometry split; when touching the wrapper, re-verify the
pass-through path with a fixed-seed run on stock OpNovice2 geometry before
merging (see CLAUDE.md, *Verification discipline*).

### Interactive (UI + visualization)

```bash
./BBRSim
```

Requires a Geant4 build with UI and visualization drivers enabled.

## Project plan and team
